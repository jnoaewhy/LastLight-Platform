## REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURE

### WebSocket Channels (Room Structure)

**Patron Rooms:**
- `venue:public` - Public venue updates
- `patron:{patron_id}` - Personal notifications
- `activity_buddy:all` - Social features
- `group:{group_id}` - Group chat

**Staff Rooms:**
- `staff:all` - All staff broadcasts
- `staff:{employee_id}` - Personal tasks/notifications
- `department:{dept}` - Department chat
- `venue:internal` - Internal updates

**Manager Rooms:**
- `management:all` - All manager broadcasts
- `manager:{manager_id}` - Personal notifications
- `venue:internal` - Internal updates
- `alerts:critical` - Emergency alerts
- `department:{dept}` - Their department

**Owner Rooms:**
- `owner:master` - Owner-only channel
- `management:all` - See all manager stuff
- `staff:all` - See all staff stuff
- `venue:internal` - All internal updates
- `alerts:critical` - All emergency alerts
- `financials:live` - Live revenue stream

### Key Real-Time Events

**Venue Metrics (Every 5 seconds):**
```javascript
io.to('venue:public').emit('venue_metrics_update', {
  occupancy, queue_times, active_challenges, trending_now
});
```

**Order Status Updates:**
```javascript
// Patron orders → Kitchen receives → Preparing → Ready
io.to(`patron:${patron_id}`).emit('order_update', {
  order_id, status, message, notification
});
```

**Emergency SOS:**
```javascript
// Staff SOS → Instant broadcast to all managers + owner
io.to('alerts:critical').emit('emergency_alert', {
  alert_id, type, severity, employee, location, details
});
```

**Staff Clock Events:**
```javascript
// Staff clocks in → Management sees update
io.to('management:all').emit('staff_clock_event', {
  event_type, employee_id, time, verified, on_duty_count
});
```

**Owner Broadcast:**
```javascript
// Owner sends → ALL staff receive
io.to('staff:all').emit('owner_broadcast', {
  broadcast_id, priority, message, requires_acknowledgment
});
```

**Revenue Ticks:**
```javascript
// Every transaction → Owner sees live update
io.to('financials:live').emit('revenue_tick', {
  amount, category, new_total_today, transaction_id
});
```

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Recommended Stack: Hybrid Approach

**Frontend Apps → Vercel (FREE)**
- Instant deploys on git push
- Global CDN
- Auto SSL certificates
- Zero config

**Backend API → Railway ($5-20/month)**
- Node.js + Express
- WebSocket server (Socket.io)
- Auto scaling
- Built-in metrics

**Database → Supabase (FREE → $25/month)**
- PostgreSQL
- Built-in auth
- Real-time subscriptions
- Auto backups
- Currently: FREE tier with 30+ tables live

**Additional Services:**
- Stripe: Payments (2.9% + $0.30/transaction)
- AWS S3: File storage (~$5/month)
- Twilio/FCM: Push notifications (~$20/month)

**Total Starting Cost: ~$30/month**

### Deployment URLs (Future)
```
app.thelantern.com        → Patron app
staff.thelantern.com      → Staff app
manage.thelantern.com     → Manager app
owner.thelantern.com      → Owner app
api.thelantern.com        → Backend API
```

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS & WHY

### Why Supabase?
- Built on PostgreSQL (rock solid)
- Auto-handles auth with JWT
- Row-level security built in
- Real-time subscriptions out of the box
- Free tier is GENEROUS
- Easy to scale when needed

### Why Railway for Backend?
- Easier than managing a VPS
- Auto-deploys from GitHub
- Built-in monitoring
- Scales automatically
- Cheap to start ($5/month)

### Why Vercel for Frontend?
- Best developer experience
- Instant deploys
- Global CDN = fast everywhere
- Free for this use case
- One `vercel` command and you're live

### Why Socket.io for Real-Time?
- Battle-tested WebSocket library
- Auto-reconnection
- Room/namespace system perfect for our use case
- Fallback to polling if WebSockets fail
- Works great with Redis for scaling

### Font Choices
- **Orbitron:** Geometric, futuristic, perfect for headers
- **Rajdhani:** Clean, techy, readable for body text
- **Audiowide:** (Available but not used yet) Good for accent text

### Color Coding by App
- **Patron:** Sunset neon (purple/pink/orange) - fun, inviting, gaming paradise
- **Staff:** Emerald green - energetic, professional, "let's work"
- **Management:** Cyber blue/cyan - technical, command center vibes
- **Owner:** Platinum/black - absolute power, imperial control

## KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: localStorage not supported in Claude artifacts
**Solution:** Use React state (useState, useReducer) or in-memory storage

### Issue: Can't import most npm packages in artifacts
**Solution:** Use only approved libraries (lucide-react, recharts, lodash, d3, mathjs, papaparse, xlsx)

### Issue: WebSocket connection in demo
**Solution:** Mock with setTimeout for demos, implement real Socket.io in deployed backend

### Issue: Biometric auth on web
**Solution:** Use browser's native WebAuthn API + keychain integration (Apple/Google Password Manager)

---

## WHAT'S NEXT

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. ✅ Database schema created and working
2. 🔄 **Create Node.js API backend** (CURRENT TASK)
3. Wire up frontend apps to real API
4. Set up Railway deployment
5. Deploy all 4 apps to Vercel
6. Connect real-time WebSockets
7. Integrate Stripe payments
8. Add push notifications
9. Beta test with 5-10 users
10. Go live!

### Timeline Estimate:
- **Week 1:** API backend + basic deployment (CURRENT)
- **Week 2:** Wire apps to real data + WebSockets
- **Week 3:** Payments + notifications + polish
- **Week 4:** Beta testing + bug fixes
- **Week 5:** PUBLIC LAUNCH 🚀
